### Hi, I'm Zan ğŸ‘‹

I'm a developer advocate interested in everything tech related.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on bringing AI & ML into developers' toolsets everywhere
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the DevOps principles
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about serverless, app architecture, AI & ML (or beer or airplanes)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: [zmarkan](https://twitter.com/zmarkan) on the bird site, or [zan@markan.me](mailto:zan@markan.me)
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I co-own two breweries, one of them alcohol free.
